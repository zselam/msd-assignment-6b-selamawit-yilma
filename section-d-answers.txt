1.a) I would suggest to use JSON.

  b) XML is more secure but we for the following reasons listed below and more it would be a good idea for them to switch to JSON
     * XML is likely for providing a rigid data structure
     * XML has a lot of syntactic worthless to receive something useful 
     * Parsing and validating an XML file can take a large amount of memory and cross-browser parsing is difficult
     * Addition of tags and a variety of attributes will lend to extra weight which could affect the performance of the app

  c) Here are few reasons why i suggest JSON over XML
     * JSON has a much lighter structure can be used to easily exchange JS object between systems. Since JS is designed to read such data 
       and deserialize it into objects it ll make the data to be available to the rest of the code in the system. 
     * JSON parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object and consumes very less memory space
     * JSON supported by most browsers and by many Ajax toolkit 
     * JSON library does not require any other library for processing.

2. The api can return a single message ' Invalid username or password', which works for all the three cases.
