1.a) I would suggest to use JSON.

  b) XML is more secure but we for the following reasons listed below and more it would be agood i dea for them to swich to JSON
     * xml is likely for providing a rigid data structure
     * it has a lot of syntatic worthless to receive something usefull 
     * parsing and validating an XML file can take a large amount of memory and cross-browser parsing is difficult
     * addition of tags and a variety of attributes will lend to extra weight which could affect the performance of the app

  c) Here are few reasons why i suggeest JSON over XML
     * JSON has a much lighter structure can be used to easily exchange JS object between systems. Since JS is designed to read that data 
       and deserialize it into objects it ll make thr data to be available to the rest of the code in the system. 
     * its parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript objec and consumes very less memory space
     * its supported by most browsers and by many Ajax toolkit 
     * JSON library does not require any other library for processing.
