1. git checkout -b branch name

2. Its not a good idea to work on a single branch for may reasons like 
    * first we should not mess with master branch, since this the main branch where everything get merged eventually we should not directly affect
      this. Mater is like a production branch. 
    * we can not do pull request since comparing same branch is not possible
    * if we add uncompleted work and push it to this branch, other will have broken state to work on
    * we have to continuously communicate with the other developer before changing files ,which is time killing  
    * it could lead to merge conflict and so on...

3. config : configuration options, like email, username
   description : this file gives description about the repository
   HEAD: considered as a pointer to the tip of the branch youâ€™re working on

4. git remote add origin  https://github.com/zselam/msd-assignment-6b-selamawit-yilma.git
   git pull origin master
   git checkout -b fixes
   git add .
   git commit -m 'merge-updates-to-master'
   git push origin fixes
   -- then create pull request from fixes to base master
